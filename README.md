# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
Heart Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning is a project of data science in which we use python. 
We analyse the heart data taken from UCI repository and train our system using machine learning to predict whether a person has heart disease or not.
In health care there is no way to accurately predicting that a person heart health is good or not. 
By taking some test doctor see values and predict about the persons health.
Data Science and machine learning (ML) can be very helpful in the prediction of heart attacks in which different risk factors can be considered. 
The objective of this project is to optimize the prediction of heart disease using ML.
This system has good accuracy hence it predict heart disease more accurately and can be healful for doctors.
To make this system first we take data from uci repository.
After this we clean the data.
then we analyze and preprocess the data and do various visualization.
Then we standardized the data and split the data into train and test data.
At the end apply various machine learning algorithms to get the best accuracy and find that random forest gives best accuracy.
Thank you..
